# === BEHAVIOR ===

## customize list output
#
# TODOTXT_SORT_COMMAND will filter after line numbers are
# inserted, but before colorization, and before hiding of
# priority, context, and project.
#
# export TODOTXT_SORT_COMMAND='env LC_COLLATE=C sort -f -k2'

# TODOTXT_FINAL_FILTER will filter list output after colorization,
# priority hiding, context hiding, and project hiding. That is,
# just before the list output is displayed.
#
# export TODOTXT_FINAL_FILTER='cat'
